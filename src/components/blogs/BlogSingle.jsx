            What Ayurveda says about citrus fruits

            According to Ayurvedic principles, citrus fruits are considered
            acidic in nature. As such, they require careful pairing with other
            foods to reap their benefits and avoid potential imbalances. Avoid
            pairing with spicy foods: Consuming citrus fruits with spicy foods
            can lead to sensitive bowel movements and gut health issues. Eat
            citrus fruits separately: Ayurveda recommends eating citrus fruits
            on their own, without combining them with other foods, to allow for
            optimal digestion and absorption of their nutrients. Consider
            timing: It’s suggested to eat citrus fruits in the morning, on an
            empty stomach, rather than in the evening, to avoid disrupting
            digestion and potentially causing indigestion. Be mindful of dosha
            imbalances: Citrus fruits’ acidic nature can lead to Pitta and Kapha
            imbalances in the body if consumed with incompatible foods.
            Ayurvedic practitioners advise pairing citrus fruits with foods that
            balance these doshas to maintain overall health. Notably, Ayurveda
            emphasizes the importance of digestion and the potential for
            incompatible food combinations to lead to indigestion, toxins, and
            even disease. Grapefruit, in particular, is recommended to be eaten
            with the pulp, before other foods, to aid in balancing acid
            reactions and relieving constipation. By following these guidelines,
            individuals can harness the nutritional benefits of citrus fruits
            while maintaining harmony in their digestive system and overall
            well-being, as per Ayurvedic principles.
